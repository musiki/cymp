In Stranger Visions I collected hairs, chewed up gum, and cigarette butts from the streets, public bathrooms and waiting rooms of New York City. I extracted DNA from them and analyzed it to computationally generate 3d printed life size full color portraits representing what those individuals might look like, based on genomic research. Working with the traces strangers unwittingly left behind, the project was meant to call attention to the developing technology of forensic DNA phenotyping, the potential for a culture of biological surveillance, and the impulse towards genetic determinism.

The forecast of Stranger Visions came true. Just 2 years later [Parabon NanoLabs](http://snapshot.parabon-nanolabs.com/) launched a service they called DNA "snapshot" to police around the US. For more examples see [Identitas](http://www.identitascorp.com/) and read about [their collaboration with the Toronto police](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/20/5916661/the-most-advanced-police-sketch-ever-might-solve-cold-cases).

Since this time I have devoted critical efforts to discussing the limitations and bias in phenotyping technology, which I (and many scientists) do not consider accurate or impartial enough for use in criminal investigations. For a discussion of my concern that this may become a new form of racial profiling see my article ["Sci-fi Crime Drama with a Strong Black Lead"](http://thenewinquiry.com/sci-fi-crime-drama-with-a-strong-black-lead/) in the New Inquiry magazine.

This work was created with the support of [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org/) and the mentorship of [Genspace](https://www.genspace.org/)and NYU's Advanced Media Studio. It is in the collection of the Centre Pompidou and private collections worldwide.
